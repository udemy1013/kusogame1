## Leaderboards Authoring

This package supports deployments thanks to its integration with the [Deployment package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.services.deployment@latest).

As a result, Leaderboards assets can be created, modified, and uploaded from the Editor.

For more information, read the full [documentation](./Authoring/index.md).
